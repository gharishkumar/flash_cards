Polity,"It started the process of decentralization by restoring the legislative powers to Bombay and Madras Presidencies. • Indian Council Act 1892: • It provided for the nomination of non-official members in the central legislative council. • It also expanded the function of the legislative council by giving them the power to discuss the budget. • Indian Councils Act, 1909: • It introduced the system of Commun"
Economy,"3. On the Structure of Interest Rates The major recommendations on the structure of interest rates are: (i) Interest rates to be broadly determined by market forces; (ii) All controls of interest rates on deposits and lending to be withdrawn; (iii) Concessional rates of interest for PSL of small sizes to be phased out and subsidies on the IRDP loans to be withdrawn; (iv) Bank rate to be the anchor rate and all other interest rates to be closely linked to it; and (v) The RBI to be the sole authority to simplify the structure of interest rates. 4. On Structural Reorganisation of the Bank For the structural reorganisation of banks some major suggestions were given: (i) Substantial reduction in the number of the PSBs through mergers and acquisitions—to bring about greater efficiency in banking operations; (ii) Dual control of RBI and Banking Division (of the Ministry of Finance) should go immediately and RBI to be made the primary agency for the regulation of the banking system; (iii) The PSBs to be made free and autonomous; (iv) The RBI to examine all the guidelines and directions issued to the banking system in the context of the independence and autonomy of the banks; (v) Every PSB to go for a radical change in work technology and culture, so as to become competitive internally and to be at par with the wide range of innovations taking place abroad; and (vi) Finally, the appointment of the Chief Executive of Bank (CMD) was suggested not to be on political considerations but on professionalism and integrity. An independent panel of experts was suggested which should recommend and finalise the suitable candidates for this post. 5. Asset Reconstruction Companies/Fund To tackle the menace of the higher non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks and financial institutions, the committee suggested setting up of asset reconstruction companies/funds (taking clue from the US experience). The committee directly blamed the Government of India and the Ministry of Finance for the sad state of affairs of the PSBs. These banks were used and abused by the GoI, the officials, the bank employees and the trade unions, the report adds. The recommendations were revolutionary in many respects and were opposed by the bank unions and the leftist political parties. There were some other major suggestions of the committee which made it possible to get the following things done by the government: (i) opening of new private sector banks permitted in 1993; (ii) prudential norms relating to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning by banks on the basis of objective criteria laid down by the RBI; (iii) introduction of capital adequacy norms (i.e., CAR provisions) with international standard started; (iv) simplification in the banking regulation (i.e., via board for financial supervision in 1994); etc."
